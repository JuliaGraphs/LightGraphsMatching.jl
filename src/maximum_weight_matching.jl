maximum_weight_matching{T <:Real}(g::Graph, w::Dict{Edge,T} = Dict{Edge,Int64}())

Given a graph `g` and an edgemap `w` containing weights associated to edges,
returns a matching with the maximum total weight.
`w` is a dictionary that maps edges i => j to weights.
If no weight parameter is given, all edges will be considered to have weight 1
(results in max cardinality matching)

The efficiency of the algorithm depends on the input graph:
  - If the graph is bipartite, then the LP relaxation is integral.
  - If the graph is not bipartite, then it requires a MIP solver and
  the computation time may grow exponentially.

The package JuMP.jl and one of its supported solvers is required.

Returns MatchingResult containing:
  - a solve status (indicating whether the problem was solved to optimality)
  - the optimal cost
  - a list of each vertex's match (or -1 for unmatched vertices)
